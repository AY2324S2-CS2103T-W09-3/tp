* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students modified from the sample project provided by NUS School of Computing CS2103T teaching team**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _CulinaryContacts_) specially designed for family-owned restaurant owners or managers to manage contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[CulinaryContacts Product Website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/tp/)**.
