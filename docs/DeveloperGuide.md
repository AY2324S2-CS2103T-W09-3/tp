## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The architecture diagram given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` and `Reservation` objects (which are contained in the
  `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueReservationList` objects respectively.
  * Note that we have two `UniquePersonList` objects: one called `persons` representing the contacts list and another called `archivedPersons` for the archived list.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Reservation` objects in the same fashion as 'selected' `Person` objects.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Help Command

The implementation of help command is more related to the Ui part of the code compared to other commands as it opens another window to show the command summary. It is facilitated by the `handleHelp` method in the `MainWindow` class.

The following activity diagram shows how a user views the help window with the `help` command.

<puml src="diagrams/HelpActivityDiagram.puml" alt="HelpActivityDiagram" />

Given below is an example usage scenario of the `help` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The user will see the main window of the address book.

Step 2. The user executes the `help` command to open the help window. The `MainWindow#executeCommand()` will call `MainWindow#isShowHelp()` to check if the command to be executed is a `help` command. The `help` command is detected and causes `Model#handleHelp()` to be called which opens the help window.

Step 3. The user looks through the command summary table to find the information needed.

Step 4. The user can copy the website address by clicking `Copy URL` button in the help window and navigate to the website for more detailed information.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note** The user can do this anytime as long as the help window is opened.

</box>

Step 5. The user can then click the `X` on top right corner or press`Q` on keyboard to close the help window.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How help window is presented:**

* **Option 1 (current choice):** The website address and things to note on top of a command summary table.
  * Pros: Useful and convenient summary for easy reference.
  * Cons: May need to modify every time a new command is added.

* **Option 2:** Only the website address.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and no change needed in the future.
  * Cons: Not very useful and convenient as a quick reference.

### Filter command

The filtering of contacts by tag is facilitated by `HasMatchingTagPredicate`. It implements the `Predicate<Person>` interface and overrides the `test(Person)` method, which is used to decide which `Person`s will be displayed after the filter command. The `test(Person)` method will return true only if the person has a tag matching every filter tag.

Here is the class diagram for `FilterCommand`.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterCommandClass.puml" alt="FilterClassDiagram" />

The following sequence diagram shows how a filter command goes through the `Logic` component.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="FilterSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `FilterCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

### Clear command

To safeguard against accidentally clearing the contacts list, the `clear` command requires the user to input a confirmation after the initial `clear` command. This is performed with the use of the two flags in the `ModelManager` class, namely `isAwaitingClear` and `isConfirmClear`, where their statuses are checked within the execution of the `clear` command since the model is passed to the command.

Another flag, `previouslyClear`, is used in the `LogicManager` class to check if the previous command was a `clear` command before handling the current command entered, where it checks if a confirmation "y" is entered.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `clear` command:

<puml src="diagrams/ClearCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ClearCommandActivityDiagram" />

### Archive command

The `archive` command essentially removes the person from the `UniquePersonList persons` and places the person into the `UniquePersonList archivedPersons` in the address book, hiding the person's contact from the main list.


<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveCommandObjectDiagram0.puml" alt="ArchiveCommandObjectDiagram0" />

In this example, Irfan Ibrahim was initially in the `persons` list, at `INDEX` 1.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveCommandObjectDiagram1.puml" alt="ArchiveCommandObjectDiagram1" />

After being archived, Irfan was removed from the `persons` list and added to the `archivedPersons` list.

The `archive` command has its corresponding `unarchive` command which conversely removes the person from the `archivedPersons` list and adds them into the `persons` list inside the address book.

There is also the associated `alist` command that displays all the contacts that have been added into the `archivedPersons` list.

Archiving in CulinaryContacts has also been implemented in a way that allows for all other commands to be performed on the archived list. This was achieved by modifying the `FilteredList<Person> filteredPersons` within the `ModelManager` class to dynamically contain either the archived persons or the normal persons. This is because many of the original commands already make use of the `filteredPersons` list to execute the commands on. For commands that do not use the `filteredPersons` list in their execution, the flag `isViewingArchivedList` within the `ModelManager` is used instead in order to check if the user is currently viewing the normal persons or the archived persons before performing the command on the corresponding list.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 4

1. **Use an ID field as the unique identifier**: The current unique identifier is the `NAME` of the person preventing addition of duplicate names. This is too restrictive as persons with the same name are quite common in reality. The user may also want to only record the first or last name which may cause more duplicate names. We plan to introduce a new `ID` field as a unique identifier for each contact, which will allow duplicate names to be recorded.
2. **Sync contact updates with reservation**: Currently, when a user edits a contact's `NAME` or `PHONE NUMBER` in the contacts list, these changes are not reflected in existing reservations made for that contact. As a result, the reservation records become inconsistent with the updated contact details. We plan to enhance this feature by ensuring that any updates to a contact in the contacts or archived list will automatically update the contact's details in the reservations list. For example, if the contact John Doe's phone number is updated, all existing reservations under John Doe's name will automatically reflect this new phone number.
3. **Cascading reservation deletion**: Currently, when a contact is deleted, their existing reservations remain in the address book. However, this process can be cumbersome for users, as they must manually delete each reservation individually. To enhance user-friendliness, we plan to implement cascading deletion, whereby deleting a contact will also remove all associated reservations automatically.
4. **Less compulsory fields for add command**: Currently when adding a contact, the user must input the `NAME`, `PHONE`, `EMAIL`and `ADDRESS` of the contact as all these fields are mandatory. This requirement can create difficulties if the user lacks information for all these fields. We plan to make the `PHONE`, `EMAIL`and `ADDRESS` fields optional, so that it is more convenient for the user to add new contacts.
5. **Make â€˜invalid indexâ€™ error messages cover cases where `INDEX` is less than 1 or greater than 2147483647**: The current error message which shows when the `INDEX` is less than 1 and exceeds the maximum integer size is â€˜Invalid command formatâ€™, which might not be clear for the user. We plan to show the error message `The person index provided is invalid` for these cases.
